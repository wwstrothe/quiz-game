# Code Quiz

## Description

- I created a Multiple Choice quiz on JavaScript Fundamentals. 
- Languages used: Javascript, HTML, CSS.
- The user has 10 seconds per question on the quiz. 
- Answers can be updated in a separate js file for future ease of access.
- Minimal CSS used, so that bootstrap can be used in the future to modify.
- When start button is clicked, a timer starts and a question appears. 
- When the questions is answered, another question is presented.
- When answered incorrectly, 5 seconds are subtracted from the time.
- When the timer reaches 0 or there are no more questions, the game is over.
- Score can be submitted to high score board.
- High Score board can be accessed from game start
- User can clear the High score Sheet
